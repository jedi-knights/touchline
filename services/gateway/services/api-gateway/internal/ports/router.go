// RequestRouter is the primary inbound application port for the gateway use case.
// HTTP handlers depend on this interface — never on the concrete GatewayService type.
//
// Route resolves the upstream route for an inbound request. It returns
// ErrNoRouteMatched (via the error chain) when no route is configured for the
// request, and a non-nil AppError for infrastructure failures.
//
// Contract: Route must not retain the headers map after returning. Callers may
// return it to a sync.Pool immediately after Route returns. Implementations that
// need header values must copy them before Route returns.
